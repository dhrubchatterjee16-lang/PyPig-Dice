# 🎲 PyPig-Dice: A Multiplayer Risk-Reward Game

**PyPig-Dice** is a terminal-based implementation of the classic "Pig" dice game. It is a game of luck and strategy where 2-4 players compete to reach a score of 50. The catch? If you roll a 1, you lose all the points you accumulated during that turn!
